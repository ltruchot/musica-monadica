# musicxml-random-generator

## An haskell/wasm score generator for music beginners


This is a **WIP** project about generating randomized [MusicXML](https://www.w3.org/2021/06/musicxml40/) score, helping beginners to practice scoped sets of notes.

For now, params will be in [european solf√®ge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solf%C3%A8ge) (aka "Fixed DO",romance-language) notation (do-re-mi-fa-sol in place of C-D-E-F-G).

And it will be oriented for **cello**.
