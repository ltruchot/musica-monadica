# musicxml-random-generator

## An haskell/wasm score generator for music beginners


This is a **WIP** project about generating randomized [MusicXML](https://www.w3.org/2021/06/musicxml40/) score, helping beginners to practice scoped sets of notes.

For now, params will be in [european solf√®ge notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solf%C3%A8ge) (aka "Fixed DO", or "romance language", do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-si over C-D-E-F-G-A-B).

And it will be oriented for **cello**.
